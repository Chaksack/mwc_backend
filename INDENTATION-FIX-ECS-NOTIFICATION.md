# ECS Notification Indentation Fix

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml` had indentation issues with the ECS deployment notification section. The issue was reported as:

> fix indentation and keep the send-ecs-deployment-notification:

## Root Cause

After examining the workflow file, I identified the following indentation issues:

1. The `send-ecs-deployment-notification:` section was incorrectly indented, causing YAML parsing errors.
2. It was defined at the same level as the steps, but with a colon at the end, making it appear as a separate job or section.
3. The notification steps under it were also indented incorrectly, not aligning with other steps in the job.

## Solution

The fix involved:

1. Converting `send-ecs-deployment-notification:` from a separate section to a step ID
2. Properly indenting the step to align with other steps in the job
3. Fixing the indentation of the notification steps under it

### Before:

```yaml
      # Send Slack notification for successful deployment
    send-ecs-deployment-notification:
        name: Send Slack notification - Success
        if: success()
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_CHANNEL: deployments
          # ... other env variables ...

      # Send Slack notification for failed deployment
        name: Send Slack notification - Failure
        if: failure()
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_CHANNEL: deployments
          # ... other env variables ...
```

### After:

```yaml
      # Send Slack notification for successful deployment
      - id: send-ecs-deployment-notification
        name: Send Slack notification - Success
        if: success()
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_CHANNEL: deployments
          # ... other env variables ...

      # Send Slack notification for failed deployment
      - name: Send Slack notification - Failure
        if: failure()
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_CHANNEL: deployments
          # ... other env variables ...
```

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Valid YAML Syntax**: The workflow file now has valid YAML syntax and will be properly parsed by GitHub Actions.
2. **Preserved Label**: The `send-ecs-deployment-notification` label is preserved as an ID for the step, as requested.
3. **Consistent Formatting**: The step indentation is now consistent with other steps in the workflow file.
4. **Improved Readability**: The properly indented steps make the workflow file easier to read and understand.

## Verification

The workflow file was validated to ensure that all YAML syntax is correct and that the workflow structure follows GitHub Actions best practices.
