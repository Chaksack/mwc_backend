# Root Route Status Code Fix

## Issue

The issue description requested to "add a return status 200 ok to the / route". While the application was already returning a 200 OK status code for the root route by default, it wasn't explicitly set in the code.

## Changes Made

The root route handler in `internal/api/routes.go` was modified to explicitly set the status code to 200 OK:

```go
// Before
app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    return c.JSON(fiber.Map{
        "message": "Welcome to Montessori World Connect API",
        "version": "1.0",
        "documentation": "/swagger/index.html",
    })
})

// After
app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    return c.Status(200).JSON(fiber.Map{
        "message": "Welcome to Montessori World Connect API",
        "version": "1.0",
        "documentation": "/swagger/index.html",
    })
})
```

## Explanation

In the Fiber framework, if no status code is explicitly set, it defaults to 200 OK for successful responses. However, for clarity and to meet the specific requirement, the status code is now explicitly set using the `c.Status(200)` method.

This change ensures that the root route always returns a 200 OK status code, making the behavior more explicit and easier to understand.

## Benefits

1. **Explicit Behavior**: The code now explicitly states the intended status code, making it clearer to developers.
2. **Consistent API**: This approach is consistent with best practices for API development, where status codes should be explicitly defined.
3. **Improved Documentation**: The explicit status code serves as self-documentation, indicating the expected behavior of the endpoint.

## Verification

The change has been tested to ensure that the root route still returns the same JSON response but now with an explicitly set 200 OK status code.
