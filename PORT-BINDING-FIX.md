# Port Binding Fix for Container Deployment

## Issue

The container deployment was failing with the following error:

```
‚ùå Container is not listening on port 8080
```

Despite the container running successfully and no errors appearing in the logs, the application was not binding to port 8080 as expected.

## Root Cause

After examining the code, I identified that the issue was in the `main.go` file. The application was retrieving the port to listen on from the `PORT` environment variable, but there was no default value if this environment variable was not set.

```go
// Start server
port := os.Getenv("PORT")

// Always start server with HTTP
log.Printf("Server starting with HTTP on port %s", port)
if err := app.Listen(":" + port); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to start server: %v", err)
}
```

If the `PORT` environment variable was not set, the application would try to listen on ":" (without a port number), which would fail silently. The application would continue running, but it wouldn't be listening on any port.

## Solution

The fix was to add a check for the `PORT` environment variable and set a default value of "8080" if it's not set:

```go
// Start server
port := os.Getenv("PORT")
if port == "" {
    port = "8080" // Default to port 8080 if PORT environment variable is not set
    log.Printf("PORT environment variable not set. Defaulting to %s", port)
}

// Always start server with HTTP
log.Printf("Server starting with HTTP on port %s", port)
if err := app.Listen(":" + port); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to start server: %v", err)
}
```

This ensures that the application always binds to port 8080 if no other port is specified, which matches the port exposed in the Dockerfile (`EXPOSE 8080`).

## Verification

After making this change, the container should now properly bind to port 8080, and the container test in the GitHub Actions workflow should pass.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Variable Documentation**: Ensure that all required environment variables are documented in the README.md file and other documentation.

2. **Default Values for Critical Settings**: Consider adding default values for other critical settings to ensure the application can start with minimal configuration.

3. **Logging Improvements**: Add more detailed logging around application startup to make it easier to diagnose similar issues in the future.

4. **Health Check Endpoint**: Consider adding a dedicated health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) that returns a 200 OK response when the application is running correctly.
