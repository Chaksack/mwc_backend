# GitHub Actions Workflow Indentation Fix

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to fix indentation issues in the `.github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml` file.

## Issues Fixed

The following indentation issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Job Definition Indentation**: Several jobs were incorrectly indented, causing them to be interpreted as steps rather than separate jobs:
   - `push-image-to-ecr`
   - `test-container-functionality`
   - `send-slack-test=notification` (also renamed)
   - `send-deployment-notification`

2. **Invalid Job Name**: The job `send-slack-test=notification` had an equals sign in its name, which is not recommended for YAML keys. It was renamed to `send-slack-test-notification`.

3. **Invalid Nesting**: The `slack-notification-ecs` section was incorrectly placed within the steps of the `deploy-to-ecs` job, causing a syntax error.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Job Indentation**: All jobs are now properly indented with 2 spaces at the beginning of the line, following the standard GitHub Actions workflow format.

2. **Added Missing Job Properties**: For each job, added the necessary properties:
   - `name`: A human-readable name for the job
   - `runs-on`: The type of runner to use (ubuntu-latest)
   - `needs`: Dependencies on other jobs to ensure proper execution order
   - `env`: Environment variables specific to the job

3. **Fixed Step Indentation**: All steps within jobs are now properly indented with 6 spaces (2 for the job, 2 for "steps:", and 2 for the step itself).

4. **Removed Invalid Sections**: Removed the `slack-notification-ecs` section and properly indented the Slack notification steps within the `deploy-to-ecs` job.

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Correct Workflow Execution**: The workflow will now execute as intended, with jobs running in the correct order based on their dependencies.

2. **Improved Readability**: The consistent indentation makes the workflow file easier to read and understand.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: The properly structured workflow file will be easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Verification

The workflow file was validated to ensure that all YAML syntax is correct and that the workflow structure follows GitHub Actions best practices.
