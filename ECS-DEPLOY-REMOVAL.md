# ECS Deployment Steps Removal

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to remove the ECS deployment steps from the GitHub Actions workflow file (`aws-ecr-push.yml`).

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the workflow file:

1. **Removed ECS-related Environment Variables**
   - Removed the following environment variables from the global `env` section:
     - `ECS_CLUSTER: mwc-cluster`
     - `ECS_SERVICE: mwc-backend-service`
     - `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: mwc-backend`
     - `CONTAINER_NAME: mwc-backend`

2. **Removed the `deploy-to-ecs` Job**
   - Removed the entire `deploy-to-ecs` job that was responsible for:
     - Checking out the code
     - Configuring AWS credentials
     - Preparing the task definition
     - Replacing environment variables with GitHub secrets
     - Updating the container image
     - Registering the new task definition
     - Checking if the ECS cluster and service exist
     - Deploying to ECS
     - Waiting for service stability
     - Providing a deployment summary

3. **Removed the `send-ecs-notification` Job**
   - Removed the entire `send-ecs-notification` job that was responsible for:
     - Sending Slack notifications about the ECS deployment status
     - Reporting success or failure of the ECS deployment

## Remaining Workflow

The remaining workflow now focuses solely on:

1. Building and pushing the Docker image to Amazon ECR
2. Testing the container functionality
3. Sending Slack notifications about the build, push, and test results

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Simplified Workflow**: The workflow is now simpler and more focused on building, pushing, and testing the Docker image.
2. **Reduced Complexity**: The workflow no longer includes the complex ECS deployment steps.
3. **Faster Execution**: The workflow will execute faster as it no longer includes the time-consuming ECS deployment steps.
4. **Clearer Responsibility**: The workflow now has a clearer responsibility: building, pushing, and testing the Docker image, rather than also handling deployment.

## Next Steps

If ECS deployment is still needed, it can be implemented in a separate workflow file or using a different approach, such as:

1. Creating a separate workflow file specifically for ECS deployment
2. Using AWS CodeDeploy or another deployment service
3. Implementing a manual deployment process
