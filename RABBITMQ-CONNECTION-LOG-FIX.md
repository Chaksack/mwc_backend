# RabbitMQ Connection Log Fix

## Issue

The application was logging contradictory messages about the RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connection status. Specifically, it would log a warning about failing to connect to RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ, but then immediately log a success message:

```
2025/06/30 17:48:56 Warning: Failed to connect to RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ: failed to connect to RabbitMQ: dial tcp: lookup b-2de22452-52d2-9020-bcd1e8f7c40e.mq.us-east-1.on.aws on 10.0.0.2:53: no such host
2025/06/30 17:48:56 RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connected successfully.
```

This was confusing and potentially misleading for users and monitoring systems.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `main.go` file, where the code was always logging a success message regardless of whether the connection to RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ was successful or not:

```go
// Initialize RabbitMQ (Amazon MQ)
rabbitMQService, err := queue.NewRabbitMQService(cfg.RabbitMQURL, cfg.RabbitMQUseTLS, cfg.RabbitMQCertPath)
if err != nil {
    // Log the error but continue execution
    log.Printf("Warning: Failed to connect to RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ: %v", err)
    // Create a no-op RabbitMQ service
    rabbitMQService = &queue.RabbitMQService{}
} else {
    defer rabbitMQService.Close() // Ensure RabbitMQ connection is closed on exit
}
// Always log success to ensure the workflow can detect this message
log.Println("RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connected successfully.")
```

The comment "Always log success to ensure the workflow can detect this message" suggests that this was intentional to make the GitHub Actions workflow pass, but it's misleading and could cause confusion.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the code to only log the success message when the connection is actually successful, and to log a more appropriate message when using a no-op service:

```go
// Initialize RabbitMQ (Amazon MQ)
rabbitMQService, err := queue.NewRabbitMQService(cfg.RabbitMQURL, cfg.RabbitMQUseTLS, cfg.RabbitMQCertPath)
if err != nil {
    // Log the error but continue execution
    log.Printf("Warning: Failed to connect to RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ: %v", err)
    // Create a no-op RabbitMQ service
    rabbitMQService = &queue.RabbitMQService{}
    // Log a message indicating we're using a no-op service but the application can continue
    log.Println("Using no-op RabbitMQ service. Message queue functionality will be disabled.")
} else {
    defer rabbitMQService.Close() // Ensure RabbitMQ connection is closed on exit
    // Only log success when we actually connected successfully
    log.Println("RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connected successfully.")
}
```

## Benefits

This change provides the following benefits:

1. **Clarity**: The log messages now accurately reflect the actual state of the RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connection.
2. **Transparency**: Users and monitoring systems can now clearly see when the application is using a no-op RabbitMQ service.
3. **Maintainability**: The code is now more maintainable as it follows the principle of least surprise.

## Note for GitHub Actions Workflow

If the GitHub Actions workflow was relying on the "RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connected successfully" message to determine if the test was successful, it may need to be updated to also consider the "Using no-op RabbitMQ service" message as a successful outcome, or to use a different criterion for success.
