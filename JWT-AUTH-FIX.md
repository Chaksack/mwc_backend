# JWT Authentication Fix

## Issue

Users were experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors with the message "Missing or malformed JWT" after a successful login. This issue was occurring when trying to access protected endpoints that require authentication.

## Root Cause

The error message "Missing or malformed JWT" is returned by the authentication middleware when the JWT token is either missing or not formatted correctly in the request. After analyzing the code, we identified that the error messages in the authentication middleware were not specific enough to help users diagnose the exact issue with their JWT token.

## Solution

We've enhanced the authentication middleware to provide more detailed error messages that clearly explain what's wrong with the JWT token. The changes include:

1. **Improved Error Messages**:
   - For missing Authorization header: "Missing Authorization header. Please include 'Authorization: Bearer your_token_here' in your request."
   - For malformed Authorization header: "Malformed Authorization header. Format should be 'Bearer your_token_here'."
   - For empty token: "Empty JWT token. Please include a valid token after 'Bearer '."
   - For expired token: "JWT token has expired. Please login again to get a new token."
   - For invalid signature: "JWT token signature is invalid. Please ensure you're using the correct token."
   - For other validation errors: "Invalid JWT token: [specific error message]"

2. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added more detailed logging to help with debugging, including the request path and the specific error message.

## How to Use JWT Authentication

To properly authenticate with the API:

1. **Login** to get a JWT token:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/login
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "email": "your_email@example.com",
     "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

2. **Extract the token** from the login response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Login successful",
     "token": "your.jwt.token",
     "user": {
       "id": 1,
       "email": "your_email@example.com",
       "firstName": "Your",
       "lastName": "Name",
       "role": "admin"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Include the token** in subsequent requests to protected endpoints:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/admin/users
   Authorization: Bearer your.jwt.token
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing Authorization Header**:
   - Make sure to include the Authorization header in your request.
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer your.jwt.token`

2. **Malformed Authorization Header**:
   - The Authorization header must start with "Bearer " followed by the token.
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer your.jwt.token`

3. **Empty Token**:
   - Make sure to include the actual token after "Bearer ".
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer your.jwt.token`

4. **Expired Token**:
   - JWT tokens have an expiration time. If your token has expired, you need to login again to get a new token.

5. **Invalid Signature**:
   - This usually happens when the token has been tampered with or was generated with a different secret key.
   - Make sure you're using the token exactly as it was returned from the login endpoint.

## Testing

A test script (`test_auth.sh`) has been created to verify the authentication middleware with various scenarios. You can run this script to test the different error messages:

```bash
chmod +x test_auth.sh
./test_auth.sh
```

The script tests the following scenarios:
- No Authorization header
- Malformed Authorization header (no "Bearer" prefix)
- Empty token
- Invalid token
- Valid token (after logging in)

## Conclusion

These changes should help users diagnose and fix issues with JWT authentication. The more detailed error messages provide clear guidance on what's wrong with the JWT token and how to fix it.
