# Health Path Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the current health check configuration and explains why no changes are needed to meet the requirement of updating the health path to "/" when the application starts running.

## Current Configuration

### Root Route Handler

The application already has a root route handler defined in `internal/api/routes.go`:

```go
// Root route handler
app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    return c.JSON(fiber.Map{
        "message": "Welcome to Montessori World Connect API",
        "version": "1.0",
        "documentation": "/swagger/index.html",
    })
})
```

This handler returns a JSON response with a welcome message, version information, and a link to the documentation. It responds to requests to the root path ("/") with a 200 OK status code.

### Health Check Configuration

The health check is configured in `task-definition.json`:

```json
"healthCheck": {
  "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8080/ || exit 1"],
  "interval": 30,
  "timeout": 5,
  "retries": 3,
  "startPeriod": 60
}
```

This configuration uses curl to make a request to the root path ("/") on port 8080. The `-f` flag causes curl to return a non-zero exit code if the server returns an error (HTTP status code >= 400), which would cause the health check to fail.

## Analysis

The health check is already configured to use the root path ("/") when the application starts running:

1. The application serves a response at the root path ("/") through the root route handler.
2. The health check in the task definition is configured to check the root path ("/").
3. When the application starts, it automatically sets up this route and begins responding to requests at the root path.

## Conclusion

No changes are needed to meet the requirement of updating the health path to "/" when the application starts running, as this is already the current configuration. The application already serves a response at the root path, and the health check is already configured to use this path.
