# Workflow Integration: ECR Push and ECS Deploy

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to integrate the ECS deployment functionality directly into the ECR push workflow, eliminating the need for a separate workflow.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Added ECS Environment Variables to aws-ecr-push.yml**
   - Added environment variables for ECS deployment (ECS_CLUSTER, ECS_SERVICE, ECS_TASK_DEFINITION, CONTAINER_NAME)
   - These variables are used by the new deploy-to-ecs job

2. **Added deploy-to-ecs Job to aws-ecr-push.yml**
   - Created a new job called "deploy-to-ecs" that runs after the "build-and-push" job completes
   - This job includes all the steps from the aws-ecs-deploy.yml workflow:
     - Checkout code
     - Configure AWS credentials
     - Login to Amazon ECR
     - Get AWS account ID
     - Prepare task definition
     - Replace environment variables with GitHub secrets
     - Update container image in task definition
     - Register new task definition
     - Deploy to ECS
     - Wait for service stability
     - Provide deployment summary
     - Send Slack notifications

3. **Created Job Dependency**
   - Used the "needs" keyword to ensure the deploy-to-ecs job runs after the build-and-push job completes successfully
   - This ensures that the image is built and pushed to ECR before attempting to deploy it to ECS

## Benefits

This integration provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Workflow**: Only one workflow is needed instead of two, making it easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to set up workflow_run triggers between workflows
3. **Improved Reliability**: The ECS deployment is directly tied to the ECR push, reducing the chance of deployment failures due to workflow trigger issues
4. **Better Visibility**: All steps (build, push, and deploy) are visible in a single workflow run
5. **Faster Deployments**: The ECS deployment starts immediately after the ECR push completes, without waiting for GitHub Actions to trigger a separate workflow

## Usage

The workflow can be triggered in two ways:

1. **Automatically**: When code is pushed to the staging branch
2. **Manually**: By using the "Run workflow" button in the GitHub Actions UI and selecting the target environment

No additional configuration is needed to use the updated workflow.

## Next Steps

The aws-ecs-deploy.yml workflow can now be removed from the repository, as its functionality has been integrated into the aws-ecr-push.yml workflow.
