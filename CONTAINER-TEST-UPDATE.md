# Container Test Functionality Update

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to the container test functionality in the GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing the Docker image to AWS ECR.

## Issue

The previous test functionality would fail if the container failed to run, even if database migration and AmazonMQ connection were successful. According to the requirement, the test should be considered successful if database migration and AmazonMQ connection are successful, even if the container fails to run afterward.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the `.github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml` file:

1. **Reordered Test Steps**
   - Moved the database migration and AmazonMQ connection check before the container running check
   - This ensures that we check the critical functionality first

2. **Changed Success Criteria**
   - Modified the container running check to be a warning instead of an error
   - Modified the container logs error check to be a warning instead of an error
   - The test now only fails if database migration or AmazonMQ connection fails

3. **Updated Slack Notifications**
   - Updated the success notification to clarify that the test is considered successful if database migration and AmazonMQ connection are successful
   - Updated the failure notification to clarify that the test only fails if database migration or AmazonMQ connection fails

## Test Flow

The updated test flow is as follows:

1. Pull the Docker image from ECR
2. Run the container with the necessary environment variables
3. Wait for the container to start
4. Check if database migration and AmazonMQ connection were successful (required)
5. Check if the container is running (warning only)
6. Check container logs for errors (warning only)
7. Check if the container is listening on port 8080 (warning only)
8. Check if the application responds to HTTP requests (warning only)
9. Clean up the container
10. Send Slack notification about the test results

## Success Criteria

The test is now considered successful when:
- Database migration completes successfully
- AmazonMQ connection is established successfully

The test will issue warnings but still succeed when:
- The container fails to start
- There are errors in the container logs
- The container is not listening on port 8080
- The HTTP request fails or returns an error status code

## Failure Criteria

The test will fail only when:
- Database migration fails
- AmazonMQ connection fails

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Focus on Critical Functionality**: The test now focuses on the critical functionality (database migration and AmazonMQ connection) rather than container startup or HTTP endpoint responsiveness.

2. **Reduced False Negatives**: The test will no longer fail due to issues that don't affect the core functionality, reducing false negatives.

3. **Better Visibility**: The Slack notifications now provide clearer information about what is required for a successful test and what is optional.

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the test accurately reflects the requirements for the application to function correctly in the AWS ECS environment, focusing on the critical components (database migration and AmazonMQ connection) rather than container startup or HTTP endpoint responsiveness.
