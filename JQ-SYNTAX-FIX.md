# JQ Syntax Fix for GitHub Actions Workflow

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the following errors:

```
jq: error: syntax error, unexpected ';' (Unix shell quoting issues?) at <top-level>, line 4:
      $key = .name;                  
jq: error: Possibly unterminated 'if' statement at <top-level>, line 3:
    if .value | endswith("_PLACEHOLDER") then    
jq: error: syntax error, unexpected else, expecting ';' or ')' (Unix shell quoting issues?) at <top-level>, line 8:
    else    
jq: 3 compile errors
Error: Process completed with exit code 3.
```

## Root Cause

After examining the workflow file, I identified that the issue was in the jq command used to replace environment variable placeholders with GitHub secrets in the task definition. The jq script had several syntax errors:

1. **Incorrect Variable Assignment**: In jq, variables cannot be assigned using the `$key = .name;` syntax with semicolons.
2. **Missing Parentheses**: The condition in the if statement was missing parentheses, which is required in jq.
3. **Unnecessary Intermediate Variables**: The script was using unnecessary intermediate variables that were complicating the logic.

The problematic jq script was:

```jq
jq --slurpfile env env-values.json '
  .containerDefinitions[0].environment |= map(
    if .value | endswith("_PLACEHOLDER") then
      $key = .name;
      $placeholder = .value;
      $value = $env[0][$key];
      .value = $value
    else
      .
    end
  )
' task-definition.json > task-definition-updated.json
```

## Solution

The solution was to fix the jq syntax by:

1. Adding parentheses around the condition in the if statement
2. Simplifying the variable assignment by directly setting the value
3. Removing the semicolons which were causing syntax errors

The corrected jq script is:

```jq
jq --slurpfile env env-values.json '
  .containerDefinitions[0].environment |= map(
    if (.value | endswith("_PLACEHOLDER")) then
      .value = $env[0][.name]
    else
      .
    end
  )
' task-definition.json > task-definition-updated.json
```

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Valid jq Syntax**: The script now uses valid jq syntax that will be properly parsed.
2. **Simplified Logic**: The logic is now simpler and easier to understand.
3. **Reliable Execution**: The workflow will now execute reliably without syntax errors.

## Verification

After making these changes, the workflow should run successfully without the previous jq syntax errors. The task definition will be properly updated with the values from GitHub secrets.
