# Test Functionality Update

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to the container test functionality in the GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing the Docker image to AWS ECR.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the `.github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml` file:

1. **Updated Test Criteria**
   - Changed the test to mark as successful when database migration and AmazonMQ connection are successful, even if the container is not listening on port 8080.
   - Added a specific check for the log messages "Database migration completed." and "RabbitMQ/Amazon MQ connected successfully."
   - Changed the port 8080 availability check to issue a warning instead of failing the test.
   - Changed the HTTP request test to issue a warning instead of failing the test.

2. **Updated Slack Notifications**
   - Updated the Slack notification for successful tests to separate required tests (container startup, database migration, AmazonMQ connection) from optional tests (port availability, HTTP endpoint responsiveness).
   - Updated the Slack notification for failed tests to focus on the critical issues (container startup, errors in logs, database migration, AmazonMQ connection).

## Reason for Changes

The changes were made to address the issue where the test was failing even when the database migration and AmazonMQ connection were successful, just because the container was not listening on port 8080. The new test criteria better reflect the actual requirements for the application to function correctly in the AWS ECS environment.

## Test Flow

The updated test flow is as follows:

1. Pull the Docker image from ECR
2. Run the container with the necessary environment variables
3. Check if the container is running
4. Check the container logs for errors
5. Check if database migration and AmazonMQ connection were successful (required)
6. Check if the container is listening on port 8080 (optional)
7. Check if the application responds to HTTP requests (optional)
8. Clean up the container
9. Send Slack notification about the test results

## Success Criteria

The test is now considered successful when:
- The container starts successfully
- There are no errors in the container logs
- The database migration completes successfully
- The AmazonMQ connection is established successfully

The test will issue warnings but still succeed when:
- The container is not listening on port 8080
- The HTTP request fails or returns an error status code

## Failure Criteria

The test will fail when:
- The container fails to start
- There are errors in the container logs
- The database migration fails
- The AmazonMQ connection fails

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the test accurately reflects the requirements for the application to function correctly in the AWS ECS environment, focusing on the critical components (database migration and AmazonMQ connection) rather than the optional components (port availability and HTTP endpoint responsiveness).
