# ECR Push Workflow Fix

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing Docker images to Amazon ECR was failing with the following error:

```
Run # Set environment-specific tag
The push refers to repository [***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/***]
An image does not exist locally with the tag: ***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/***
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause

After examining the workflow file, I identified the root cause of the issue:

The workflow was split into two separate jobs:
1. `build-and-push`: This job built the Docker image and tagged it
2. `push-image-to-ecr`: This job attempted to push the image to ECR

The problem is that GitHub Actions runs each job on a fresh runner (virtual machine), so the Docker image built in the first job was not available in the second job. When the second job tried to push the image, it failed because the image didn't exist locally on that runner.

## Solution

The solution was to combine the build and push operations into a single job. This ensures that the Docker image is available locally when it's time to push it to ECR.

### Changes Made

1. **Combined Build and Push Operations**:
   - Moved the Docker push commands from the `push-image-to-ecr` job into the `build-and-push` job
   - Added them right after the Docker build command to ensure the image is pushed immediately after it's built

2. **Updated Job Dependencies**:
   - Updated the `needs` parameter for the `test-container-functionality` and `deploy-to-ecs` jobs to depend on `build-and-push` instead of `push-image-to-ecr`

3. **Fixed Indentation Issues**:
   - Fixed indentation issues with the Slack notification steps in the `deploy-to-ecs` job

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Simplified Workflow**: The workflow is now simpler with fewer jobs, making it easier to understand and maintain
2. **Improved Reliability**: The build and push operations are now guaranteed to run on the same runner, eliminating the "image not found" error
3. **Faster Execution**: The workflow will execute faster because it doesn't need to set up a separate runner for the push operation

## Verification

After making these changes, the workflow should successfully build and push the Docker image to ECR without the "image not found" error.
