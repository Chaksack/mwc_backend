# GitHub Actions Workflow Syntax Fix

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml` was failing with the following error:

```
The workflow is not valid. .github/workflows/aws-ecr-push.yml (Line: 378, Col: 1): Unexpected value 'deploy-to-ecs'
```

This error occurred because the `deploy-to-ecs` job was not properly indented according to YAML syntax requirements for GitHub Actions workflows.

## Root Cause

In GitHub Actions workflow files, all jobs must be defined under the `jobs:` key with proper indentation. The `deploy-to-ecs` job was incorrectly defined at the root level of the YAML file (without indentation), rather than being properly nested under the `jobs:` section.

Before the fix:
```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-push:
    # job definition...

  push-image-to-ecr:
    # job definition...

  # other jobs...

deploy-to-ecs:  # <-- This line was at the wrong indentation level
    name: Deploy to ECS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # rest of job definition...
```

## Solution

The fix was to properly indent the `deploy-to-ecs` job to make it a child of the `jobs:` key, consistent with the other jobs in the workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-push:
    # job definition...

  push-image-to-ecr:
    # job definition...

  # other jobs...

  deploy-to-ecs:  # <-- Now properly indented with 2 spaces
    name: Deploy to ECS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # rest of job definition...
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Valid Workflow Syntax**: The workflow file now has valid YAML syntax and will be properly parsed by GitHub Actions.
2. **Proper Job Execution**: The `deploy-to-ecs` job will now be recognized as part of the workflow and will execute as intended.
3. **Consistent Formatting**: The job indentation is now consistent with other jobs in the workflow file.

## Verification

After making this change, the workflow syntax should be valid, and GitHub Actions should be able to run the workflow without syntax errors.
